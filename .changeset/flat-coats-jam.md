- Now you can use the CLI without global installation. Just run:
  ```
  npx project-initializer-cli@latest
  ``` 
- Add the `-c <path>` flag to select directory where you want to initialize the project. Also you can use a globally alias like `~/...`. 
- I have written the <a href="https://github.com/HzDev3628/project-initializer-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTION</a> documentation. 
- Add a title before start the commands.
- Update <a href="https://biomejs.dev">Biome</a> config.
